You may not need to use all the water. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Shape beef into 8 patties, about 3/8-inch-thick and 4 inches in diameter. Sprinkle with pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoonoil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches as needed, add patties to skillet. Spread 2 teaspoon mustard over top of each patty. Cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Top patties with cheese is melted. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 defrees F (70 degrees C). Layer patties to create 4 stacks.</li>
            <li>Spread sauce onto bun bottoms. Fill each bun with 4 pickles, a tomato slice, lettuce, and 1 patty stack.</li>
